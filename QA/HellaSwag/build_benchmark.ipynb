      "option1: []\n",
      "option2: Pure platinum can also be suited with platinum, as it has the good coating over it and is made from lithium. Pure platinum rings are free from rust, and have titanium or zinc pieces.\n",
      "option3: Although it may not be 100% pure, it is often purer than other precious metals, like gold. [substeps] A ring that is 95% pure will be an expensive, but worthwhile choice. This may not seem like a key element to use with platinum, but it is a key element-anything with high purity values is a good choice. You can choose to have one less metal in your ring, but you cannot get only one.\n",
